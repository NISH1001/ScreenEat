# ScreenEat
Screenshots made delicious

# What the heck is it?
It is a simple tool to make sharing your desktop screenshots super easy.  
It offers you to share the screenshot by immediately uploading the snap to `imgur` (for now) and gives you an immediate sharable `url`  

# Why?
Reason is simple : `no local storage` `immediate share`  
Forget all those time-waste process of :  

1. `printscreen`  
2. save to local storage  
3. send the file to someone you want to share  

Instead the process is simplified as:  

1. hit those default keybindings of ours  
2. If `automatic upload` is enabled, a sharable `url` is provided immediately  
3. If `automatic upload` is disabled, you get a chance to upload or save it to local storage  

# Ok! I want to use it, but how?

### Clone this repo first

```
git clone https://github.com/NISH1001/ScreenEat.git
```

### Our default key binding
Into the cloned folder, run the `keybindings.py` script as : 

```
./keybindings.py
```

*No need to run this `keybindings.py` script again. The bindings are now global. No harm's done if you re-run it, by the way. *  

Once done our keybindings are :  
* `ctrl+super+p` : whole desktop screenshot
* `ctrl+super+o` : active window screenshot
