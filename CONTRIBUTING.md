# Strictly follow the guidelines !!

# Git
-------------

## 1. commit message
Use **active** voice for commit message.  
For example:  
> add memory efficient data structure

Instead of:
> added memory efficient data structure

## 2. no redundant commits
Please! don't push redundant commits whenever you change your code.  
For example (redundant commit):
> edit README.md

> fix typo in README.md

# Python
-------------

Strictly follow [pep-8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)  
Following are some of the imposed conventions that every pythonista must follow:

## 1. function definitions
- use lower case for every function names
- in case the function has multiple words, separat by an **underscore**
- `do_this()`

## 2. packages
- same as in function definitions
- be sure to create a package in a folder that contains `__init__.py`
- `package`

## 3. Classes
- use **UpperCaseCamelCase** convention like this one
- `Exception` classes should end in **Error**
- `ScrapError`
- **public** variables should be all lower case seperated by an underscore
- `self.my_list`
- **private** variables should begin with a **single** underscore

## 4. Constants
- use **FULLY_CAPITALIZED** name for constants
- if multiple words, separate them by an underscore
